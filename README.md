# Music Java Unit Test and Functional Test

This project demonstrates the implementation of functional tests for a music streaming service using Cucumber and JUnit.

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to create a suite of functional tests that verify the behavior of a music streaming service. The tests are written using the Cucumber framework and are executed using the JUnit test runner. This combination allows for writing clear, concise, and human-readable test scenarios while leveraging the power and flexibility of JUnit.

## Technologies Used

1. Cucumber: A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) framework that enables writing functional tests in a natural language format.
2. JUnit: A widely-used testing framework for Java applications that provides a set of annotations and assertions for writing and running tests.

## Features Tested

The following features of the music streaming service are tested using Cucumber scenarios:

1. Searching for music tracks by title
2. Playing a selected music track
3. Creating an album containing multiple music tracks

## Getting Started

To run the functional tests, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
3. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed (Cucumber and JUnit).
4. Run the Cucumber test suite using the JUnit test runner (typically by right-clicking the Cucumber test class and selecting "Run").
